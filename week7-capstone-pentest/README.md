# Capstone Pentesting Project – Kenobi Lab

## Project Overview

This repository documents a full penetration testing engagement on the **"Kenobi"** lab environment. The objective was to perform **reconnaissance, initial access, privilege escalation, post-exploitation, and reporting**, while maintaining detailed, sanitized documentation for educational purposes.

The project demonstrates:

- Information gathering and enumeration  
- SSH access using a private key  
- Privilege escalation techniques  
- Exploitation of misconfigurations and SUID binaries  
- Professional report writing and risk assessment  

> ⚠️ This repository is for **educational purposes only**. Do not attempt to exploit systems without proper authorization.

## How to Navigate

1. **Documentation**
   - Start with `docs/01_recon.md` to understand how reconnaissance was performed.  
   - Follow `docs/02_exploitation.md` and `docs/04_priv-esc.md` for step-by-step privilege escalation.  
   - `docs/methodology.md` explains the high-level approach.  

2. **Findings**
   - Review `findings/payloads.md` for sanitized exploit commands.  
   - `findings/CVE-references.md` provides relevant vulnerability references.  

3. **Reports**
   - `report/executive-summary.md` is suitable for non-technical readers.  
   - `report/pentest-report.md` is a full, professional report with all findings and recommendations.
