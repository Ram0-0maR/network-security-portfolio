# Web Exploitation (Excluded from Capstone Scope)

During the 7-week training, multiple web exploitation scenarios were completed
(e.g., Basic Pentesting, Pickle Rick, and other TryHackMe web labs).  

For the capstone project, the scope is intentionally limited to **Kenobi** 
to provide a focused end-to-end penetration test report.  

Therefore, no additional web exploitation tasks are included here.
