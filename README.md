# 🚀 Network & Security Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my personal learning journey through the worlds of **networking, cybersecurity, and cloud engineering**.

This GitHub repository documents an 7–9 week self-guided summer exploration where I rolled up my sleeves, built real labs, broke things on purpose, secured them, and reflected honestly on the process. It’s not just about learning tech — it's about discovering what excites me, where I struggle, and what kind of engineer I want to become.

## 🎓 Who Am I?

I’ve just finished my *classe prépa intégrée*, and next year I’ll be entering the *cycle d’ingénieur* at ENSA EL JADIDA. Before diving headfirst into a specialization, I wanted to **test-drive core areas of network and security engineering** — to see if I really enjoy this domain, or if my interests lie elsewhere like cloud, automation, or software.

This portfolio is my **sandbox and compass** — a personal space where I experiment, reflect, and figure things out.

## 🧭 What's in This Portfolio?

Each week focused on a different domain — from foundational IP networking to Linux system hardening, from ethical hacking to cloud networking. I used tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, Kali Linux, TryHackMe, AWS**, and many more.

You'll find:

- 🧪 Hands-on labs & simulations  
- 📸 Screenshots and expected outputs  
- 📜 Bash scripts, configs, logs  
- ✍️ Personal reflections on each step  
- 🧠 Study notes and concept breakdowns  

All organized week-by-week inside dedicated folders. It’s part technical journal, part learning diary.

## 🌱 Why I’m Doing This

I wanted to answer questions like:

- What does a network or security engineer really do?
- Do I enjoy the puzzle-solving side of system defense?
- What kind of technology excites me enough to dive deep?
- Am I more drawn to **infrastructure**, **defense**, or **cloud architecture**?

Rather than guessing, I built this portfolio to **try things myself** — to see how it feels to configure ACLs, chase down open ports, secure a Linux system, or set up a cloud VPC.

## 🔭 What's Next?

This portfolio is still evolving. I’ll keep expanding it with:

- New labs and projects  
- Cleaner write-ups and summaries  
- More focused reflection on career fit  
- (Maybe) a personal blog or final project

## 📬 Feedback Welcome

If you're a student, mentor, or professional who's done something similar, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Feel free to open issues, share tips, or connect.

This is not a finished product — it’s a snapshot of a young engineer figuring out what to love.
