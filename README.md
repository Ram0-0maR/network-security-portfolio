# Network & Security Engineering Portfolio

## About This Repository

This repository represents my personal journey into the world of network and security engineering, a field I am exploring to understand if it aligns with my interests and professional goals.

Having just completed my "classe prépa intégrée," I will begin an engineering cycle next year. This portfolio helps me experiment with various domains — from foundational networking concepts and cybersecurity basics to cloud technologies — to discover what truly excites me and where I want to focus my future studies and career.

This is a self-discovery process, combining hands-on labs, tool practice, and weekly reflections to test concepts like subnetting, routing, packet analysis, VLANs, ACLs, network security threats, firewalls, VPNs, and cloud infrastructure.

## Roadmap Overview

My 8-week learning journey is structured as follows:

- **Weeks 1–2:** Foundations of Networking — IP addressing, subnetting, TCP/IP basics, and small network simulations.
- **Week 3:** Intermediate Networking — Routing protocols, VLANs, ACLs, and switching concepts.
- **Week 4:** Introduction to Cybersecurity — Understanding threats, basic ethical hacking, and defensive techniques.
- **Week 5:** Firewalls, VPNs, and Cloud Networking — Learning perimeter defenses, VPN setups, and exploring AWS and virtual networks.
- **Week 6:** Hands-On Projects — Applying knowledge in real-world scenarios like home lab setup, VPN tunneling, and vulnerability scanning.
- **Weeks 7–8:** Certification Prep and Reflection — Preparing for industry certifications and evaluating my progress and interests.

Each week contains labs, notes, tool usage (Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, TryHackMe, pfSense, etc.), and my personal reflections on what I learned and found challenging.

## Purpose & Goals

This portfolio is not a polished professional showcase yet, but a transparent record of my learning process as I figure out if network and security engineering is the right path for me — including my growing interest in cloud technologies.
