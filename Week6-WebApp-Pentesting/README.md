# Week 6 – Web Application Penetration Testing

## Overview
This repository documents my Week 6 journey on Web Application Penetration Testing using **Kali Linux**.  
The focus was on testing and exploiting common web vulnerabilities in safe lab environments (DVWA & OWASP Juice Shop), practicing with industry-standard tools, and producing a professional pentest report.

## Tools & Platforms
- **Kali Linux** (Live USB / VM)  
- **Burp Suite Community Edition** – HTTP interception & manipulation  
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** – SQLi, Auth, Command Injection  
- **OWASP Juice Shop** – XSS, DOM, and general web vulnerabilities  
- **sqlmap** – Automated SQL Injection testing  
- **TryHackMe / PortSwigger Web Security Academy** – Optional safe remote labs

## Daily Highlights
- **Day 1 – HTTP Interception**: Learned HTTP anatomy, intercepted & modified requests with Burp Suite.  
- **Day 2 – Reconnaissance**: Manual & automated app mapping, fingerprinting tech stack.  
- **Day 3 – Authentication & Session Testing**: Tested login forms, session fixation, brute-force (DVWA).  
- **Day 4 – SQL Injection & Command Injection**: Extracted database info with sqlmap, practiced safe command injection.  
- **Day 5 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Exploited reflected and DOM-based XSS in Juice Shop.  
- **Day 6 – Other Web Vulnerabilities**: Studied CSRF, file upload attacks, directory traversal, open redirects.  
- **Day 7 – Report & GitHub**: Organized all work, produced sanitized documentation, created portfolio-ready repo.

## Notes
- All exercises performed in **local lab / safe platforms**.  
- Sensitive data such as passwords, session IDs, or live server info has been **removed** for safety.
