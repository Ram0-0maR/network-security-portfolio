ðŸŸ¦ Day 6 â€“ Build a Hardening Toolkit

Today I built my own Linux hardening toolkit by writing a Bash script (kali\_hardener.sh) that automates everything I practiced in Days 1â€“5. The script updates the system, locks the root account, creates a secure sudo user, configures UFW to allow only port 2222, hardens SSH, removes vulnerable services, and enables Fail2Ban. I tested the script on a fresh Kali instance and verified the results using nmap, ss, and manual inspection of configs. I also created a hardening checklist to confirm all actions were applied. This experience taught me how to turn security principles into reproducible, actionable code. It also made me think about scalability: in a real environment, you wouldnâ€™t harden one system manually â€” youâ€™d deploy these controls through scripts or orchestration tools. Iâ€™m proud of how the script turned a vulnerable system into a hardened one within seconds. This is exactly the kind of automation Iâ€™d use in a real security team.
