ðŸŸ¦ Day 3 â€“ Vulnerable Services: Exploit \& Defend

Today I intentionally turned my Kali system into a vulnerable target to better understand how exposed services can be exploited. I installed and ran services like vsftpd, apache2, and telnet, then used tools like nmap -sV, ftp, and telnet to simulate attacks. I was able to log in anonymously to the FTP server and upload a file â€” a textbook misconfiguration that still exists on real networks. After identifying these weaknesses, I stopped and removed the services using systemctl and apt, restoring the system to a more secure state. This lab demonstrated the lifecycle of a misconfigured service: how easily it can be deployed, how obvious it becomes to attackers scanning your machine, and how dangerous it is if left unpatched. It also reminded me that vulnerability management isnâ€™t theoretical â€” attackers exploit whatâ€™s convenient. Being able to flip between offense and defense made me appreciate how quickly a neglected service becomes an entry point.
