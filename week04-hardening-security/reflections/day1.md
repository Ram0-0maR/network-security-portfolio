ðŸŸ¦ Day 1 â€“ System Baseline: Whatâ€™s Running on Kali?

On Day 1, I established a security baseline for my Kali Linux system by identifying active services and open ports immediately after boot. Using commands like whoami, ps aux, ss -tuln, and netstat -tulnp, I examined running processes and network sockets. I also used nmap -sS localhost to simulate how an external attacker would enumerate open ports. I was surprised to find services like SSH, Apache2, and even CUPS running by default â€” even though Kali is intended for offensive security, itâ€™s not hardened out-of-the-box. This exercise made it clear how a seemingly secure machine can expose unnecessary services if left unchecked. It reinforced the importance of starting any defensive strategy with visibility. I also gained a clearer understanding of how to differentiate between local-only services and those exposed to the network. Going forward, Iâ€™ll always scan new systems as if I were an attacker first â€” because thatâ€™s often how attackers begin their work.
