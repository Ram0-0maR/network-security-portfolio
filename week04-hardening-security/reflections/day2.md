ðŸŸ¦ Day 2 â€“ Remove the Attack Surface

Todayâ€™s focus was on minimizing the systemâ€™s attack surface â€” the collection of exposed services and inputs an attacker could exploit. I used systemctl list-units --type=service to audit running services and began removing or disabling unnecessary ones like apache2, telnet, and even sshd if not actively needed. After each change, I verified results using ss -tuln and nmap. This process emphasized the principle of least privilege â€” not just for users, but for system components. What stood out to me was how many services were running by default that I didnâ€™t need, and how quietly they expose the machine to risk. Every open port is a door, and if itâ€™s not locked â€” or worse, forgotten â€” it becomes a target. This lab taught me that hardening isnâ€™t about adding complexity; itâ€™s about removing everything you donâ€™t explicitly trust. In real-world production systems, regular service audits are not optional â€” theyâ€™re critical to survival.
