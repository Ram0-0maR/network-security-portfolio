ðŸŸ¦ Day 4 â€“ SSH Brute-Force Lab

Today I explored why SSH is one of the most targeted services in the real world. I enabled sshd on Kali, created a weak user account (testuser), and used hydra to simulate a brute-force attack using the rockyou.txt wordlist. The attack succeeded quickly, proving that weak credentials are still one of the biggest threats in cybersecurity. I then secured SSH by editing /etc/ssh/sshd\_config: changing the default port from 22 to 2222, disabling root login, and optionally enabling key-based authentication. Restarting the SSH service applied the changes, and follow-up scans confirmed reduced exposure. This lab connected offensive and defensive skills: it showed how easy it is to brute-force SSH when defaults are left unchanged, and how straightforward it is to significantly reduce that risk with just a few config changes. In production, I would also enforce key-only login and monitor SSH logs continuously. SSH is powerful â€” and dangerous â€” when unguarded.
