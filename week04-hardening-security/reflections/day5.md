ðŸŸ¦ Day 5 â€“ Logging \& Alerting with Fail2Ban

Today I learned how defenders detect brute-force attempts and automate the response using Fail2Ban. I configured it on my hardened system and simulated repeated SSH login failures using hydra. After five failed attempts, Fail2Ban automatically blocked the attacking IP and logged the event in /var/log/auth.log. Using fail2ban-client status sshd, I verified the ban was active. This lab demonstrated a key principle: prevention is ideal, but detection and automated reaction are essential. What stood out was how effective Fail2Ban was out-of-the-box â€” it doesn't require complex tuning to deliver value. However, I realized how important it is to regularly check its logs and customize its ban thresholds to match real-world conditions. In production environments, I would forward Fail2Ban logs to a central SIEM and configure alerts for high-frequency bans. This lab gave me my first look at security automation from the defenderâ€™s perspective â€” and itâ€™s a game changer.
