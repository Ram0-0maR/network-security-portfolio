\## Recon

\*\*Nmap Scan\*\*

```bash

nmap -sC -sV -oN evidence/tool-output/nmap.txt 10.10.154.1

```

Open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP)



\### Web Enumeration

\- Checked HTML source – found a username.

\- `robots.txt` contained `/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt`



---



\## Exploitation

\- Logged into `/login.php` using credentials found in source code.

\- Limited command execution webshell available.

\- Uploaded reverse shell using Python one-liner.



```bash

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

```



---



\## Privilege Escalation

\- Ran LinPEAS; found `sudo` allowed running any command without password.



```bash

sudo bash

```

Gained root shell.

\## Lessons Learned

\- Always inspect page source and `robots.txt`.

\- Webshells can be used as stepping stones to full shells.

\- Unrestricted sudo is an instant win for privilege escalation.
