\## Scope

\- Target: Pickle Rick machine

\- No other systems tested.

\- Testing was non-destructive.



---



\## Methodology

1\. Recon – Nmap scan, page source, robots.txt

2\. Exploitation – Login to web portal, reverse shell upload

3\. Privilege Escalation – Sudo without password

| --- | -------------------------------- | -------- | ------ | -------------- |

| P1  | Exposed credentials in HTML      | High     | Unauthorized login | Remove hardcoded credentials |

| P2  | Unrestricted sudo access          | Critical | Full root compromise | Restrict sudo privileges |

\## Attack Narrative

1\. Identified username in page source.

2\. Found additional info in `robots.txt`.

\## Conclusion

Multiple high-risk misconfigurations allowed a trivial full compromise. These should be fixed immediately.
