# Week 5 – Penetration Testing Labs

This repository contains my Week 5 penetration testing practice from my cybersecurity learning plan.  
Two separate labs were completed:

1. **Basic Pentesting** (Day 1–5) – Methodical engagement focusing on enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation.
2. **Pickle Rick** (Day 6) – Faster-paced red team style challenge.
