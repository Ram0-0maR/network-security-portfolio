\# Penetration Test Report – Basic Pentesting



\*\*Tester:\*\* \Ramo_omaR 

\*\*Date:\*\* Week 5  

\*\*Confidentiality:\*\* Internal Use Only



---



\## Executive Summary

The Basic Pentesting target was compromised through weak credentials and insecure key permissions. The attack chain started with anonymous SMB access revealing usernames and ended with full root access via a plaintext password.



\*\*Overall Risk:\*\* Critical



---



\## Scope

\- Target: 10.10.28.38

\- Out of scope: All other hosts

\- Testing was non-destructive.



---



\## Methodology

1\. Recon – Nmap service scan

2\. Enumeration – SMB shares, usernames

3\. Exploitation – SSH brute force

4\. Post-Exploitation – Key theft and cracking

5\. Privilege Escalation – Plaintext root password

\## Findings



| ID  | Vulnerability                           | Severity | Impact | Recommendation |

| --- | --------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ | -------------- |

| F1  | Anonymous SMB Share                     | Medium   | Usernames exposed | Disable guest access |

| F2  | Weak SSH Password (`jan:armando`)       | High     | Direct shell | Enforce strong password policy |

| F3  | World-readable Private SSH Key          | High     | Lateral movement | Restrict permissions |

| F4  | Plaintext Root Password in User Home    | Critical | Root compromise | Remove plaintext passwords |



---



\## Attack Narrative

1\. Discovered SMB share allowing guest access.

2\. Retrieved usernames from `staff.txt`.

3\. Brute-forced SSH login for user `jan`.

4\. Enumerated and found `kay`'s SSH key with weak passphrase.

5\. Logged in as `kay` and found root password in plaintext.

6\. Escalated to root with `sudo su`.

\## Conclusion

Critical vulnerabilities allowed trivial compromise. Immediate remediation is advised.
